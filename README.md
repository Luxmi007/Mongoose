Mongoose is an elegant MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. It provides a straightforward schema-based solution to model your application data with built-in type casting, validation, query building, and business logic hooks. With Mongoose, you can define schemas to represent your data models and use them to perform CRUD operations on your MongoDB database, making it easier to work with MongoDB in Node.js applications.
